# Census

SCP-ET Plugin framework extension

Our discord: https://discord.gg/7JMaKjs2Vy

# Installation
Installing Census on your SCP_ET server is really simple. 
### Windows
When you download the files, just put 00CensusCore.dll and the dependencies folder in /yourserverfolder/Plugins
### Linux
It is the same as installing on Windows, just put 00CensusCore.dll and dependencies folder in /yourserverfolder/Plugins

***
# Config
All the plugins including CensusCore will have a separated config in your server folder.
Census's config will look like this:

```
{
  "IsEnabled": true //Check if census is enabled
}
```

# Plugin Configs
We do not know how the plugin developer will write his own config. So if you want to know something about it ask them ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
